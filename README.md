# Waterpark-Website

Hi there, myself Kunal Dhanawade, student studying BEIT. This repo contains files of my Sem 5 project which was to create an E-Commerce Website. Accordingly, a Waterpark Website in HTML, CSS, raw JS, Express.js and MongoDB was made by me and my group members. we also have used the Razorpay Payment Gateway for Payment/Refund purposes.

The project ‘Waterpark Website’ is a website about a dummy waterpark by the name ‘AquaLand’. This website gives detailed information about the waterpark to anyone viewing the website. The user can surf through different web pages to know about the waterpark. This website provides the facility to get the location of the waterpark, view multimedia content like images, know about the facilities and features, contact the staff via email or phone calls, etc. everything through a few clicks. 

The waterpark website also enables customers to reserve their day, i.e., book tickets to visit the waterpark via online mode through the website. Also, if the customers want to cancel their booking, they can do it on the website too. The website provides a reliable, easy and secure gateway to make payment for the product they ordered by Online Payment and Internet Banking facility. Also, the customer can get email updates of their transactions.

P. S. The images used are taken from Google and might be licensable. If you have any issues, please contact on my email- kunaldhanawade7@gmail.com. Thank you.


Express.js:

It makes it easier to organize your application’s functionality with middleware and routing. It adds helpful utilities to Node.js HTTP objects and facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTTP objects.

Why Express ?
