## Introduction

This repository contains files for my Semester 5 project, which involved creating an E-Commerce Website. Specifically, my group and I developed a Waterpark Website using HTML, CSS and JS. We also integrated the Razorpay Payment Gateway for payment and refund functionalities.

The project, titled "Waterpark Website," showcases the creation of a dummy waterpark called "AquaLand." The purpose of this website is to provide detailed information about the waterpark to visitors. By navigating through different web pages, users can explore the various features, facilities, and multimedia content, such as images, related to the waterpark. Additionally, they can easily contact the staff through email or phone calls with just a few clicks.

## Description

The Waterpark Website project aims to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website for a water park. The website allows visitors to explore the various attractions and amenities offered by the water park. It also provides the functionality for users to book tickets online, make payments, cancel bookings, and request refunds.

The website is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, ensuring a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. This responsiveness enables users to access the website seamlessly from desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

To handle server-side operations, the project utilizes Node.js and Express.js for server-side scripting. Additionally, a Mongo DB database is integrated to store user data, enabling efficient handling of online transactions and user interactions.

The website is designed with a focus on intuitive navigation, ensuring that visitors can easily find information about the water park's attractions, opening hours, ticket prices, and other relevant details. The design incorporates visually appealing elements to enhance the overall user experience.
